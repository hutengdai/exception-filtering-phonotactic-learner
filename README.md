# Exception-filtering Phonotactic Learner

## Overview
This is a public repo of the Exception-filtering Phonotactic Learner in Dai (to appear) paper. This tool is designed to model phonotactic constraints and evaluate grammaticality judgments based on user-provided linguistic data. The tool also uses customizable settings to test different datasets and phonotactic theories. I will assume you are using the Mac system, but the code should be runnable on Windows and Linux as well.

## Prerequisite
Let's first make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system. For example, run this in your command line (Terminal for Mac or Command Prompt for Windows system):
```bash
python3 --version
```
(This checks for Python 3 specifically, as macOS comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed as "python".) If you get error message like "command not found: python3", you probably don't have python properly installed. You can download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. You can find many video tutorials on the installation of python.


## Installation
To date, the easist and safest way to install pynini is through conda, run:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pynini
```
See more details about pynini here: https://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/Pynini


## Other requirements
You can install all required Python libraries using:
```bash
pip3 install -r numpy pandas matplotlib scipy plotnine
```


## Running the code
Run the script from the command line, providing necessary arguments directly. Hereâ€™s how to execute the script with all required and optional parameters:
```bash
python learner_segment_based.py <language> <structure> <max_threshold> [--weight WEIGHT] [--model MODEL]
```

Currently,
- <*language*> can be "english", "polish", or "turkish".
- <*structure*> can be "local" or "nonlocal". When you use "nonlocal", the code automatically selects the vowel tier based on the feature file. (I plan to improve this part of the code in the future.)
- <*max_threshold*> can be any value between 0.01 and 1.
- <*weight*> and <*model*> are both optional arguments, meaning you can ignore them if you just need a quick demonstration. The default value of *weight* is 10 but sometimes lower value can yield higher correlation scores in evaluation.
- The default value of <*model*> is "filtering". When you change it to "gross", you turn the Exception-filtering model to the baseline model in my paper (see section 4).

For example, if you want to train on the English data, run:
```bash
python learner_segment_based.py english nonlocal 0.1
```
Then you can find the result at:
```bash
data/english/judgment_model-filtering_struc-local_conf-0.975_pen-10_thr-0.1.txt
```
